# summer2023-ai-research
Research into artificial intelligence conducted in summer of 2023 (May to August, 2023) under a Truman State University Department of Computer Science grant under the guidance of Dr. Ruthie Halma.

This repository has not been cleaned up and is still considered a work-in-progress.

General work conducted locally on Ubuntu distro through WSL2 (Windows 11).

GUI-related OpenCV implementation conducted locally using Spyder Anaconda (Windows 11).

Model generation and heavy computing conducted virtually on sand virtual machine, Truman State University (*https://sand.truman.edu/*).

Data available on linked Discord server *https://discord.gg/D2JC36t7QE*.
